# Boost_Manager
AMD version


After code inspection, feel free to download the PMPRO, or PM_light executables/exe.
Keep in mind these are still in development.
Install the exe to desktop, open the new folder created and right click and run the main.exe as administrator.
If PMPRO has issues try PM_Light .
Keep in mind that windows defender will probably bark at you for trying to download/install

I would appreciate any and all feedback, If customtkinter has issues please pip3 install customtkinter --upgrade
