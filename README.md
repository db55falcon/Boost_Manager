# Boost_Manager
AMD version/may work with Intel


You can try this on Intel (will do no harm!) just may not work


After code inspection, feel free to download the PMPRO(has the temp features), or PM_light(no temp features) executables/exe. (Or just clone 🙃)
Keep in mind these are still in development.


Install the exe to desktop, open the new folder created and right click and run the main.exe as administrator.
If PMPRO has issues try PM_Light

Keep in mind that windows defender will probably SCREAM at you for trying to download/install the executable 

I would appreciate any and all feedback, 

If customtkinter has issues please pip3 install customtkinter --upgrade
